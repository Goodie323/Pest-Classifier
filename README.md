# Pest-Classifier
Pest Classifier Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on developing a robust image classification model to identify various pests. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can accurately categorize images into specific pest classes, providing a valuable tool for pest management in agriculture.

Project Overview
Pest management is crucial in agriculture to protect crops and ensure food security. Identifying pests early allows for timely intervention, reducing crop damage and improving yield. This project aims to aid in this process by creating an automated pest classification system that can identify pests from images.

Key Features:
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset of pest images.
Real-Time Prediction: Integrated with a Streamlit app, the model provides real-time pest classification.
User-Friendly Interface: The Streamlit app allows users to upload images and get instant predictions.
Scalable and Extendable: The model architecture and the Streamlit app are designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of new pest classes and further model training.
Technology Stack:
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
Streamlit: For creating an interactive web application to deploy the model.
Python: The primary programming language for this project.
How It Works:
Data Preparation: The dataset consists of images categorized into different pest classes. Images are preprocessed to ensure consistency in size and quality.
Model Training: The CNN is trained on the dataset, learning to identify features unique to each pest class.
Deployment: The trained model is deployed in a Streamlit app, where users can upload images for classification.
Prediction: The model processes the uploaded image and predicts the class of the pest, displaying the result in the app.
